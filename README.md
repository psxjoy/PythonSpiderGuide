This project includes some interesting things (mainly about spidering web).I hope you can feel great when you watching this code.

However,I still cannot promise that the code included in this project are correct.So if you find it,it will be greatful to correct them and pull request me!

Here the information about the files:

* Scrapy_Finalexam:

  The little tool which can notify your Final Exam points(Support python2.x and python3.x)
* Scrapy_LibraryInfo:
 
  Seriously, the code inside the folder is very messy! This is the first time i used Python to write gadgets. Get library books and    classify them using the data on the JD website.
* Zhihuerï¼š

  You know,Zhihu is a popular website,it seems everyone should spider this web ,and after that, you can say you know some Python Sipder ways.
 

## Requirements

* Python2.x or Python 3.x
* requests

 That's All! It's very simple and easy!

 But if you want to receive the mobile phone's Message about the exam score,you also need the SMS services.But you just want use E-mail,forget it!

## Quick Start

you would like to adjust some params to make tools suited for your using.

* set E-mail Address And Your peronaly information

```python
    #EmailOfFianlExam.py
    
    data = {
    'schoolIdentity': 'Some info that not suitable show',
    's_n': 'Your account',
    'p_d': 'Your password',
    'identity': 'Some info that not suitable show'
    }
    
    from_addr = 'Your Email address'
    password = 'Your Email Password'
    to_addr = 'Which Email you want to send'
    smtp_server = 'smtp Address'
